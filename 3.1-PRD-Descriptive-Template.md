# Product Requirements Document Template
## A Comprehensive Guide for Product Definition

**Document Purpose**: This Product Requirements Document (PRD) serves as the definitive source of truth for all stakeholders involved in the product development lifecycle. It bridges the gap between business vision and technical implementation, ensuring all parties share a common understanding of what will be built, why it matters, and how success will be measured.

---

## Executive Summary

### Product Vision Statement

**Guidance**: Your vision statement should inspire stakeholders while clearly articulating the transformation your product enables. It must balance aspiration with achievability, painting a picture of the future state while remaining grounded in practical outcomes.

Write your vision statement following this structure: Begin with the fundamental change your product creates in the world. Describe not just what the product does, but why it matters to your organization and users. Include specific, measurable outcomes that stakeholders can rally behind. Your vision should answer: "What world are we creating?" and "Why should anyone care?"

**Example Format**: "We envision a world where [describe the transformed state], enabled by our [product name] that [core capability]. This transformation will [specific impact on users/business], positioning our organization as [strategic position] while delivering [quantified value]."

### Strategic Alignment

**Guidance**: This section demonstrates how your product directly supports and advances organizational priorities. Each strategic objective should be explicitly linked to product capabilities, showing clear cause and effect relationships.

For each organizational objective, explain the direct connection between product features and strategic outcomes. Use concrete examples and metrics wherever possible. Address these key dimensions:

- **Business Growth**: How does this product drive revenue, reduce costs, or create new opportunities? Quantify the expected impact on market share, customer acquisition, or operational efficiency.

- **Digital Transformation**: Describe how the product modernizes operations, enhances digital capabilities, or positions the organization for future technological advances. Include specific technologies or methodologies being adopted.

- **Risk Mitigation**: Identify current risks (regulatory, operational, competitive) and explain how the product reduces exposure. Include compliance requirements, security improvements, or business continuity enhancements.

- **Competitive Positioning**: Articulate how this product creates or maintains competitive advantage. Reference market trends, competitor capabilities, and differentiation strategies.

- **Cultural Impact**: Describe how the product influences organizational culture, employee satisfaction, or ways of working. Include change management considerations.

### Value Proposition

**Guidance**: Your value proposition must resonate with different stakeholder groups while maintaining a coherent narrative. Structure your value statements hierarchically, leading with the most compelling benefits.

Present your value proposition as a series of clear, quantified statements that answer "What's in it for me?" for each stakeholder group. Each statement should follow the pattern: "By [specific capability], we enable [stakeholder group] to [achieve specific outcome], resulting in [measurable benefit]."

Primary values to address:
- Efficiency gains with time and cost savings quantified
- Quality improvements with error reduction metrics
- User experience enhancements with satisfaction targets
- Compliance achievements with risk reduction values
- Innovation enablement with future capability descriptions

### Success Metrics

**Guidance**: Define success in concrete, measurable terms that all stakeholders can understand and track. These high-level metrics should cascade down to detailed KPIs in later sections.

Your success metrics must be SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound) and directly tied to the value proposition. Include both leading indicators (predictive) and lagging indicators (outcome-based). Each metric should have:
- A clear baseline (current state)
- A specific target (future state)
- A measurement methodology
- A responsible party for tracking
- A timeline for achievement

## 1. Problem Definition & Context

### 1.1 Current State Analysis

**Guidance**: This section provides a comprehensive snapshot of today's reality, establishing the baseline against which improvement will be measured. Be brutally honest about current limitations while remaining professional and constructive.

#### 1.1.1 Existing System Architecture

**Narrative Guidance**: Document your current technology landscape with sufficient detail for technical teams to understand integration requirements and migration challenges. This isn't just an inventory—it's an analysis of how current systems enable or constrain business operations.

Begin by mapping all systems involved in current processes. For each system, document its role, age, technology stack, integration points, and known limitations. Include diagrams showing data flows and system interactions. Identify technical debt, end-of-life considerations, and scalability constraints.

Key elements to document:
- System inventory with versions, vendors, and licensing status
- Integration architecture showing APIs, file transfers, and manual touchpoints
- Performance metrics including response times, throughput, and availability
- Data volumes, growth rates, and storage locations
- Known issues, workarounds, and technical debt
- Maintenance costs and resource requirements

#### 1.1.2 Process Documentation

**Narrative Guidance**: Process documentation reveals how work actually gets done today, exposing inefficiencies and improvement opportunities. Focus on actual practices, not theoretical procedures.

Map current processes using swimlane diagrams or similar visualizations. For each process, document who does what, when, where, and how. Include both the "happy path" and exception handling. Measure cycle times, wait times, and processing times. Identify handoffs, approval bottlenecks, and rework loops.

Process elements to capture:
- Step-by-step workflows with roles and responsibilities
- Time requirements for each step (processing and waiting)
- Decision points and approval chains
- Error rates and rework frequencies
- Peak load periods and capacity constraints
- Manual interventions and their triggers
- Compliance checkpoints and audit requirements

#### 1.1.3 Pain Point Analysis

**Narrative Guidance**: Pain points are the specific, measurable problems that justify investment in a new solution. Quantify each pain point's impact to build a compelling case for change.

Structure your pain point analysis in three tiers:

**Operational Inefficiencies**: These are the day-to-day friction points that slow productivity and increase costs. Document time wasted on manual tasks, rework caused by errors, delays from poor information flow, and resource underutilization. Calculate the fully-loaded cost of these inefficiencies, including labor, opportunity costs, and overhead.

**Compliance & Risk Gaps**: Identify where current processes expose the organization to regulatory penalties, security breaches, or business disruption. Quantify potential impact using risk assessment methodologies. Include audit findings, near-misses, and industry incidents that could affect your organization.

**User Experience Friction**: Document how current systems frustrate users and impede adoption. Include metrics like task completion rates, support ticket volumes, training requirements, and user satisfaction scores. Calculate the cost of poor user experience in terms of productivity loss and support burden.

### 1.2 Problem Statement

**Narrative Guidance**: Your problem statement crystallizes the essence of what needs to be solved. It should be clear enough for executives to understand and detailed enough for solution designers to act upon.

Craft your problem statement as a narrative that tells the story of current challenges and their impact. Begin with a single, powerful sentence that captures the core problem. Then decompose this into specific, addressable components. For each component, explain the cause, effect, and cost of not solving it.

Structure your problem statement to address:
- The fundamental issue creating pain for the organization
- Specific symptoms and their measurable impacts
- Root causes that must be addressed
- Interdependencies between problem components
- The trajectory if nothing changes (problem evolution)
- The window of opportunity for intervention

### 1.3 Market & Competitive Analysis

**Narrative Guidance**: This analysis positions your solution within the broader market context, demonstrating awareness of alternatives and justifying your chosen approach.

Research and document how others solve similar problems. Include both direct competitors and analogous solutions from other industries. Analyze build vs. buy options, considering total cost of ownership, time to market, and strategic fit. Identify emerging technologies that could disrupt current approaches.

Your market analysis should explore:
- Industry best practices and their adoption rates
- Competitive solutions with strengths and weaknesses
- Technology trends affecting your solution space
- Regulatory changes driving market evolution
- Customer expectations and their evolution
- Partnership opportunities and ecosystem considerations

## 2. Stakeholder Analysis

### 2.1 Stakeholder Mapping

**Narrative Guidance**: Stakeholder mapping goes beyond listing user groups—it's about understanding the human dimension of your product. Each stakeholder group has unique needs, fears, and motivations that must be addressed for successful adoption.

#### Primary Stakeholders - End Users

For each end user group, create a rich profile that brings them to life for the development team. Describe a day in their life, their frustrations with current systems, and their hopes for improvement. Include demographic information, technical proficiency levels, and change readiness. Document both formal responsibilities and informal influences.

Consider these dimensions for each user group:
- **Functional Role**: What they do, how they do it, and why it matters
- **Emotional Context**: Their frustrations, aspirations, and fears
- **Technical Context**: Their comfort with technology and learning preferences
- **Social Context**: Their influence on others and susceptibility to peer pressure
- **Success Definition**: What winning looks like from their perspective

#### Secondary Stakeholders

Secondary stakeholders don't use the system directly but are significantly affected by its success or failure. These often include managers who rely on system outputs, finance teams who fund the initiative, and IT teams who support the infrastructure. Document their concerns, success criteria, and potential resistance points.

#### External Stakeholders

External stakeholders exist outside your organization but have legitimate interests in your product. These might include customers affected by service improvements, regulators requiring compliance evidence, or partners needing integration capabilities. Understanding their needs ensures your solution doesn't create unexpected external friction.

### 2.2 User Journey Mapping

**Narrative Guidance**: User journey maps tell the story of how stakeholders interact with current and future systems. These narratives reveal pain points, emotions, and opportunities that requirements lists might miss.

#### Current State Journeys

Document current user journeys as stories, complete with plot, conflict, and resolution (or lack thereof). Include the trigger event, each step in the process, the time required, the emotional state at each point, and the outcome achieved. Identify where users create workarounds, where they get frustrated, and where they abandon the process entirely.

For each journey, capture:
- **The Trigger**: What initiates this journey? Is it scheduled, event-driven, or random?
- **The Steps**: What specific actions must users take? Include both system interactions and offline activities.
- **The Obstacles**: Where do users struggle? What causes delays, errors, or frustration?
- **The Emotions**: How do users feel at each step? Where do they experience satisfaction or frustration?
- **The Outcome**: What is achieved? Does it meet user needs? What's left undone?

#### Future State Journeys

Future state journeys describe the transformed experience your product will deliver. These should directly address current pain points while introducing new value. Show how automation eliminates manual steps, how intelligence prevents errors, and how integration eliminates duplicate work.

Paint a picture of the improved experience:
- Reduced friction at every touchpoint
- Proactive guidance preventing errors
- Contextual information eliminating search time
- Automated workflows eliminating wait time
- Intelligent routing eliminating handoffs
